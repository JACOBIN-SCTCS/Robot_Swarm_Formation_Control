## Decentralized Formation Control of a Swarm of Quadrotor Helicopters

Implementation of the **Formation Control** and **Collision Avoidance** for a swarm of Robots from the paper  

"Decentralized Formation Control of a Swarm of Quadrotor Helicopters" (https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/8899628)

The GIF below shows a swarm of 4 robots starting at random locations eventually leading to a Square Shape Formation

### TODO
- [ ]  Add Comments 
- [ ]  Add Codes for rotation and tracking control specified in the paper
- [ ]  Perform simulation using Webots/Gazebo etc.
